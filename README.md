# Big Data Analytics – Electronica 2025

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the integration and analysis of heterogeneous business and production data to improve operational efficiency and decision-making.

The objective was to design a scalable Big Data architecture and analyze relationships between production errors, revenue and product performance.

## Problem Statement
- Business data was managed manually in Excel
- Production errors were recorded but not analyzed
- No connection between production, finance and sales data
- No Single Point of Truth

## Data Sources
- Production systems (machine logs, error types)
- Financial & sales data (revenue, costs, profit)
- Customer data
- Social media data (Twitter – concept integration)

## Architecture
- ETL / Streaming concept
- Hadoop cluster (conceptual architecture)
- HDFS & Hive
- SQL-based data analysis
- BI dashboards

## Key Analyses
- Revenue and cost trends (2012–2021)
- Profit development
- Failure rate analysis
- Pareto analysis (20% of error types cause ~80% of losses)
- Product portfolio performance
- Production optimization recommendations

## Optimization Recommendations
- Early quality assurance checks
- Focus on high-margin segments
- Reduction of dominant error sources
- Integration of predictive maintenance

## Technologies
- SQL
- Big Data architecture concepts
- Data validation
- KPI analysis
- Dashboard visualization
