# Big Data Analytics – Electronica 2025

## Objective
Design of a scalable Big Data architecture integrating production, finance and social media data to enable KPI-driven production optimization and data-based decision-making.

---

## Business Problem
- Manual Excel-based reporting (error-prone and fragmented)
- Production failures recorded but not systematically analyzed
- No integration between production, finance and sales data
- Lack of a Single Source of Truth

---

## My Contribution
- Structured heterogeneous data sources into an integrated analytical model
- Designed a conceptual Big Data architecture (ETL → Hadoop → Hive → SQL → BI)
- Conducted KPI analysis (Revenue, Cost, Profit | 2012–2021)
- Performed Pareto analysis on production failures
- Identified operational inefficiencies and margin optimization potential
- Developed data-driven improvement recommendations

---

## Data Sources
- Production systems (machine logs, error types)
- Financial & sales data (revenue, cost, profit)
- Customer master data
- Conceptual integration of social media (Twitter)

---

## Architecture Overview
Data Ingestion (ETL / Streaming)  
→ Hadoop Cluster  
→ HDFS & Hive  
→ SQL-based analysis  
→ BI Dashboard visualization  

See `architecture-diagram.png` for visualization.

## Analytical Focus

### KPI Monitoring
- Revenue development (2012–2021)
- Cost trends and margin evolution
- Profit analysis
- Revenue distribution by customer class

### Failure & Production Analysis
- Top machine failures (2020–2021)
- Failure distribution by product category
- Identification of dominant error types

### Pareto Analysis
- ~20% of error types responsible for ~80% of losses
- Quality assurance identified as a primary optimization lever

---

## Business Impact
- Transparent overview of cross-departmental KPIs
- Prioritization of high-impact failure types
- Identification of early-stage quality control improvements
- Margin-focused product portfolio evaluation
- Conceptual roadmap for predictive maintenance & real-time monitoring

---

## Technologies & Concepts
- SQL (analytical queries)
- Big Data architecture (Hadoop ecosystem – conceptual)
- ETL process design
- Data validation techniques
- KPI modeling
- Pareto principle application
